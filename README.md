## About

Kommute lets you observe the network traffic of your app for debugging purposes. It shows all connections from your OkHttp calls and displays various information like headers, request and response bodies.

Kommute uses Androids Bubble Api to show the network traffic in a hovering bubble, which makes it easily accessible while navigating through your app.
The network traffic can be observed as long as the app lives, even while it is in the background.

## Download

Kommute is a debug tool. It comes with a `no-op` version, which should be used in release builds.

```groovy
dependencies {
    debugImplementation 'com.sebastianneubauer:kommute:0.0.2'
    releaseImplementation 'com.sebastianneubauer:kommute-no-op:0.0.2'
}
```

## Usage

Add Kommutes Interceptor to your OkHttp instance.

```kotlin
val kommuteInterceptor = Kommute.getInstance().getInterceptor()

val httpClient = OkHttpClient.Builder()
        .addInterceptor(kommuteInterceptor)
        .build()
```

Get the Kommute instance and call `start` to show its notification. For example in your apps `onCreate` method.
Make sure your app has notifications enabled on Android 13+.

```kotlin
Kommute.getInstance().start(context)
```

Click the expand icon on the notification to open Kommutes Bubble.
